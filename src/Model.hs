This module contains data types and functions modeling the state of FIBS session. There are the following
levels of state:

1. /Session/: the topmost level, represents the state of entire application. Contains data such as the 
list of erros, the connection (when connected), list of players (when connected) and match state (when playing).

2. /Match/: current match score, player ids, game state (if game is in progress)

3. /Game/: the board, who has the dice etc.
